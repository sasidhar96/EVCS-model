# EVCS-model
Simulation of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS)

## Motivation
Based on given dataset that has the electric vehicle profile as to when the EV needs to be charged. A simultion model is needed to assign these EVs
to the charging station and if there are other EVs already charging then the incoming EVs are supposed to wait. These is mostly needed to analyze
when there is load on the grid based on the EV behaviour.

## steps

* First the simulation is run for given number of EVs for one EVCS and the waiting time is analyzed to for different set of EVs.
* The simulation was built for n number of EVCS and the drop in the waiting time was analyzed for the same number of EVs.
* This model is to be integrated into a planning model to determine the optimal number of EVCS for a microgrid for a given set of EVs.

## Conclusion
A state-of-the-art Charging station simulation was built that is to be utilized to analyze the EV load behaviour on the optimal sizing of 
renewable capacities and number of charging stations.
